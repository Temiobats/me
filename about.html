      <h2 id="intro">Growing up</h2>
      <p>I was born in Nigeria and spent the early years of my life there before moving to Bethesda, Maryland. Growing up in two different places gave me a unique perspective on culture and community. Maryland became the space where I grew, built friendships, and shaped many of the values that I carry with me today.</p>

      <h2 id="about">Before college</h2>
      <p>Before starting college, my life was centered around school, family, and exploring my interests. I loved staying active, trying new things in the kitchen, and finding joy in small everyday routines. These experiences shaped my curiosity and independence, and they gave me a strong foundation for the person I’m becoming.</p>

      <h2 id="history">Family roots</h2>
      <p>My family’s roots are in Nigeria, a country known for its vibrant culture, traditions, and history. My Nigerian heritage is an important part of who I am—it connects me to my background and inspires the way I see the world, approach challenges, and celebrate life with others.</p>

      <h2 id="currently">Where I am now</h2>
      <p>Currently, I’m a sophomore at New York University, studying Communications. Living in New York has been a big change from Maryland, but it has been an exciting and inspiring experience. I love exploring the city, trying out new cafes, and spending time with friends, while also focusing on my studies and personal growth.</p>

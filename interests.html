        <h2 id="fitness">Pilates & Fitness</h2>
        <p>Staying active is something I really value. I enjoy pilates, going to the gym, and keeping up with new workouts. Fitness gives me energy, balance, and helps me take care of both my mind and body.</p>

        <h2 id="cooking">Cooking</h2>
        <p>I love cooking and trying out new recipes. It’s a creative way for me to express myself, experiment with flavors, and enjoy the process of making something delicious from scratch. Sharing meals with others makes it even more special.</p>

        <h2 id="cafes">Exploring Cafes</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite things to do is explore different cafes, whether I’m looking for a cozy spot to read or a new place to try matcha lattes. Each cafe has its own atmosphere, and I love discovering unique spaces across the city.</p>

        <h2 id="friends">Spending Time with Friends</h2>
        <p>Spending quality time with friends means a lot to me. Whether we’re laughing, exploring new places, or just hanging out, those moments create memories that I truly cherish. My friends inspire me, and I love building bonds that last.</p>
